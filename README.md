# Mechathon-
## The github repository contains the solutions of two problem statements related to Mechanical Engineering.
### --> Solution 1 allows user 
### ● to calculate EOQ and optimum lot size for a deterministic inventory model. 
### ● The program also asks user if he/she wants to place an order and places on order accordingly. 
### --> Solution 2:
#### ● Takes a free body diagram of a static mechanism/structure as a vector input by defining a proper coordinate system.
#### ● Calculates the unknown forces/moments acting on some of the links, given that question is not indeterminate(i.e. Number of unknowns = number of equations).
#### ● And outputs the final solution as a vector quantity with direction as well as magnitude.
### Users can simply run the program in their code editor and find outputs of 1st problem statement (Language is python).
